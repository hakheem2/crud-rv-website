                        <strong>Powertrain coverage begins ninety (90) days and one thousand (1000) miles after the contract purchase date. A $100 deductible applies to each repair.</strong><br><br>
                        *The powertrain service contract is only available for purchase in the United States and may not be available in all areas or locations. Coverage is subject to deductibles, limits, and exclusions. The contract covers repairs only of covered parts when they suffer a mechanical breakdown, as defined in the contract. Under some circumstances, a mechanical breakdown of a covered part may not be covered. Examples include if the failure is due to misuse, lack of proper maintenance, or when a non-covered part is what caused the covered part to fail. Also, the exclusions contain a list of parts not covered, some of which may be associated with or contained in covered component groups. Examples include the walls, brake drums and rotors, fuses, head and tail light assemblies, hoses, spark plugs, and wires. Please see the vehicle service contract for details.
